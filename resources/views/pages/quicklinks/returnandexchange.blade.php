            <p><strong>The easiest way to return your product to Haus Valeriaa. </strong></p>
            <p>Prepare only the returnable product and information that will allow us to confirm your purchase - a receipt or invoice that is shipped to your order.</p>

            <p>Location<br /> Street<br /> Building<br /> Address</p>
